# Running Selenium Java Tests with TestNG

```sh

- Platform: Web
- Language: Selenium, Java, Testng

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed and configured:

* Java Development Kit (JDK): Selenium and TestNG are Java-based. Make sure you have a compatible JDK installed. Verify your installation by running `java -version` and `javac -version` in your terminal or command prompt.
* Maven : These build automation tools help manage your project dependencies (Selenium, TestNG, WebDriver drivers, etc.).
* Integrated Development Environment (IDE): While not strictly necessary, an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans makes development and execution easier.
* WebDriver Drivers: You'll need the appropriate WebDriver executable for the browser(s) you intend to test (e.g., ChromeDriver for Chrome, GeckoDriver for Firefox). Ensure these drivers are in your system's PATH or that you configure their location in your test code.


How to run

- Go to terminal
- Run  "mvn test -P testng"


```
